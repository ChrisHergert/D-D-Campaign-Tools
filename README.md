# D&D-Campaign-Tools
For writing a tabletop gaming campaign. I wrote this library and the accompanying driver for client TG Expo, and they have asked that it be made available for public use.
The CityBuilder library is the library of functions used to generate a series of cities. The library has a brief usage example included at the bottom. The created files are exported as CSV files.
The 5e Standard Races.txt file is the list of standard player races for 5th Edition, under the OCo License.
The DemoBreakdown library is the more expansive of the two libraries included, and it contains functions designed to read in a set of cities from a CSV file in the format exported by the CityBuilder library, and then to break down the cities' populations
